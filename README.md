  Project on "Digitisation of Immunization for Covid-19" under the theme of "Social Security and Awareness"
Till now, we have not encountered a pandemic as infectious and deadly as the Covid-19 pandemic. Hence, we need an effective immunisation program which ensures that if not the entire population, at least a huge majority of the population of our country is vaccinated. To ensure the effectiveness of increasingly complex immunization programs in upper-middle and high-income settings, comprehensive information systems are needed to track immunization uptake at individual and population levels.
Hence, we have introduced DiGiiMMUNO - short for Digitisation of Immunization for Covid-19.
Further information about the tech stack and  the project workflow is given in the ppt links.
